## ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¸ Pia is my very much in progress AI-powered personal investment assistant ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤–

I wanted to use AI to help me make well-informed investment and trading decisions, so I thought I'd build a personal investment assistant. The goal of open sourcing this is to showcase my thoughts on how I'm incorporating AI into something useful and value add for my personal life. Open sourcing this from the very beginning also means that it's going to go through a lot of changes and iterations, and I'm going to be documenting the process of building this at [my blog](https://www.wellingtonjohnson.com). 

The project will start pretty simple and generalized, but since this is a personal project that I plan to use regularly, it will begin to serve more of my specific needs from a financial management perspective. That being said, feel free to use this as a reference for how to build your own AI-powered personal assistant if youd like. Also feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions. I am not accepting contributions for the forseeable future, but we'll see if that changes.
